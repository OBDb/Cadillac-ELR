    description: "The Cadillac ELR was a luxury plug-in hybrid coupe based on the first-generation Chevrolet Volt's extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) platform. Featuring striking, angular design inspired by the Cadillac Converj concept car, it showcased Cadillac's Art & Science design language with dramatic proportions and distinctive vertical lighting elements. The powertrain combined a 1.4L four-cylinder gasoline engine with an electric motor and a 16.5 kWh lithium-ion battery, providing around 37 miles of electric-only range before the gasoline generator engaged to extend range to about 340 miles total. The system produced a combined 217 HP and 295 lb-ft of torque. The interior featured premium materials including leather, suede microfiber, chrome, and real wood accents, with Cadillac's CUE infotainment system as standard. Despite its technological innovation and upscale appointments, the ELR struggled in the market due to its high launch price of over $75,000 and limited practicality with a tight rear seat. A significant update for 2016 increased power to 233 HP, improved handling, and lowered the price, but these changes came too late to save the model from discontinuation after only three model years and approximately 2,900 units sold. The ELR represented Cadillac's first attempt at an electrified luxury vehicle, pioneering some of the technology and design elements that would later appear in models like the LYRIQ."
